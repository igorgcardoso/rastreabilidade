## About The Project

This Rust project is a simplified recreation of a Java Spring Boot application I originally developed during my trainee period. The goal of this project was to practice Rust programming and explore the use of Axum and SQLx. It is not intended to be a production-ready implementation, but rather a personal learning exercise.
